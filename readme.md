array-map
=========

This crate provides an array based hashmap (`ArrayMap`), which works in a no-std environment and can be used if an upper bound
for the number of keys in the map is known at compile-time.


### Credits

This crate is heavily inspired by https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown and some of the initial
documentation and tests have been copied from this project.
